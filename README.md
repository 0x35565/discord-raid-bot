# Bot status
the raid bot is still in it's early stages of development but I will contribrute to the source code whenever i can. 

# Bot Features
1. Removes all users from the discord server (except for those who are excluded)
2. Removes all channels and creates channels named "deleted"

# Important information
**How to get login token?**

Regarding login tokens, you need to login to the discord developer portal, create a bot and obtain your application token. 



# Additional info
The script uses multitprocessing which starts two parent threads and joins the threads into the main thread running the python
interpreter itself so as long as your CPU has more than 3 threads you'll be apples, pretty sure everyone does.? Unless you've got a potato. (fret not i'm also a broke boy)

I don't condone the misusing of the script, i wrote it purely to expand my horizons and deepen my knowledge on the discordpy API.

Thank you.
